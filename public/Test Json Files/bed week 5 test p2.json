    "options": ["g*t1*t2", "1/2 * g*t1*t2", "2 * g*t1*t2", "g * (t1 + t2)"],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Using the equation of motion $s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$, for vertical motion we get $h = ut - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$. Rearranging into a quadratic equation: $\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 - ut + h = 0$. The times $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the roots. The product of roots is $t_1 t_2 = \\frac{h}{g/2} = \\frac{2h}{g}$. Thus, $h = \\frac{1}{2}gt_1t_2$. Key B.Ed point: Total time of flight is $T = t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{2u}{g}$."

    "options": ["0 m", "4 m", "8 m", "16 m"],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Distance is the total path length. At $t=0$, $x=4$. At $t=2$, $x=0$. At $t=4$, $x=4$. The particle moves from $x=4$ to $x=0$ (4 meters) and then from $x=0$ back to $x=4$ (another 4 meters). Total distance = $4 + 4 = 8$ m. Note: Displacement would be 0, but distance counts the return journey."

    "options": ["50%", "100%", "125%", "225%"],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Kinetic Energy $K = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$. If momentum $p$ increases by 50%, the new momentum $p' = 1.5p$. New $K' = \\frac{(1.5p)^2}{2m} = 2.25K$. The percentage increase is $(2.25 - 1) \\times 100 = 125\\%$. In B.Ed exams, remember that if $p$ doubles, $K$ increases by 300%."

    "options": ["26 J", "27 J", "8 J", "19 J"],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Work done by a variable force is $W = \\int F dx$. Here, $W = \\int_{1}^{3} 3x^2 dx = [x^3]_{1}^{3} = 3^3 - 1^3 = 27 - 1 = 26$ J. Wrong options like 27 result from forgetting to subtract the lower limit."

    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "In a perfectly elastic collision, the coefficient of restitution $e = 1$. Since $e = \\frac{V_{\\text{separation}}}{V_{\\text{approach}}}$, it follows that $V_{\\text{approach}} = V_{\\text{separation}}$. For inelastic collisions, $e < 1$, meaning $V_{\\text{separation}}$ is less than $V_{\\text{approach}}$."

    "options": ["Bernoulli's Principle", "Archimedes' Principle", "Pascal's Law", "Torricelli's Law"],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Pascal's Law states that pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished. Bernoulli's relates to fluid speed/pressure (wings), Archimedes' to buoyancy, and Torricelli's to the speed of efflux from a tank. Hydraulic brakes and lifts are classic Pascal's Law applications."

    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Escape velocity $v_e = R \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{3}\\pi G\\rho}$. If density $\\rho$ is constant, $v_e \\propto R$. Doubling the radius $R$ doubles the escape velocity. $11.2 \\times 2 = 22.4$ km/s. If the question said 'same mass', the answer would be different ($v_e \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R}}$)."

    "options": ["r", "r²", "1/r", "1/r²"],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "According to Stokes' Law, terminal velocity $V_t = \\frac{2r^2(\\rho - \\sigma)g}{9\\eta}$. Thus, $V_t \\propto r^2$. Note that the viscous drag force $F$ itself is proportional to $r$, but the terminal velocity is proportional to the square of the radius."

    "options": ["√(rg tanθ)", "√(rg sinθ)", "√(rg cosθ)", "rg tanθ"],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "For a banked road without friction, the horizontal component of normal force provides centripetal force ($N \\sin \\theta = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$) and the vertical component balances gravity ($N \\cos \\theta = mg$). Dividing them gives $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{v^2}{rg}$, so $v = \\sqrt{rg \\tan \\theta}$."

    "options": ["Carbon dioxide", "Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)", "Methane", "Nitrous oxide"],

    "question": "The distance between the points (a cos θ, a sin θ) and (0, 0) is:",
    "options": ["a", "a²", "1", "0"],
    "answerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "Distance $d = \\sqrt{(a \\cos \\theta - 0)^2 + (a \\sin \\theta - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2(\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta)}$. Since $\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta = 1$, $d = \\sqrt{a^2} = a$."

    "question": "The centroid of a triangle with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) is:",
    "options": ["((x1+x2+x3)/2, (y1+y2+y3)/2)", "((x1+x2+x3)/3, (y1+y2+y3)/3)", "(x1x2x3, y1y2y3)", "(x1+x2, y1+y2)"],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The centroid is the average of the coordinates of the vertices. For a triangle, we divide the sum of $x$ and $y$ coordinates by 3. Dividing by 2 is for the midpoint of a line."

    "question": "The slope of the line perpendicular to 2x + 3y + 7 = 0 is:",
    "options": ["-2/3", "2/3", "3/2", "-3/2"],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Slope of the given line $m_1 = -A/B = -2/3$. Perpendicular lines satisfy $m_1 m_2 = -1$. So, $m_2 = -1/(-2/3) = 3/2$. Remember: Negative reciprocal."

  {
    "question": "Which organelle is semi-autonomous and has its own DNA?",
    "options": ["Lysosome", "Ribosome", "Mitochondria", "Golgi Body"],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Mitochondria (and Chloroplasts) have their own DNA and 70S ribosomes, allowing them to synthesize some of their own proteins. This is explained by the endosymbiotic theory. Ribosomes are for protein synthesis but lack DNA."

  {
    "question": "The crossing over of chromosomes takes place during which stage of meiosis?",
    "options": ["Leptotene", "Zygotene", "Pachytene", "Diplotene"],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Crossing over (exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids) occurs in Pachytene. Pairing (synapsis) happens in Zygotene. Diplotene is marked by the visibility of Chiasmata."

    "question": "The process of programmed cell death is known as:",
    "options": ["Necrosis", "Apoptosis", "Autolysis", "Mitosis"],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Apoptosis is a healthy, programmed cell death used to remove unwanted cells. Necrosis is accidental or traumatic cell death caused by injury or infection, which usually causes inflammation."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a stop codon in the genetic code?",
    "options": ["AUG", "UAA", "GUG", "UUU"],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "There are three stop codons: UAA (Ochre), UAG (Amber), and UGA (Opal). AUG is the start codon. UUU codes for Phenylalanine."

  {
    "question": "The primary enzyme responsible for DNA replication is:",
    "options": ["RNA Polymerase", "DNA Polymerase", "Ligase", "Helicase"],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "DNA Polymerase adds nucleotides to the growing DNA strand. Helicase unzips the DNA, and Ligase glues the Okazaki fragments together. RNA Polymerase is used for transcription (making RNA from DNA)."

    "question": "The pH of human blood is approximately:",
    "options": ["6.4", "7.0", "7.4", "8.0"],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Human blood is slightly basic, with a tightly regulated pH range between 7.35 and 7.45. Any significant deviation can be fatal."
